# Python Terminal Browser
I wanted to create a way to web search with python. I have used python cmd based program. 

## Requirement
- Python3
- Internet broswer (Chrome,Firefox)

## How to use it?
From the terminal, jump into the directory that and run the program using the following keyword:

```
python3 webbroswer.py [letter_of_search Engine] [Text search]
```

The _letter_of_search_ , is the reference for what the user is searching with.

Please check the list below in what should may be used for searching.
```
-y -> Youtube
-g -> Google
-r -> Reddit
```

```
python3 web broswer.py -g how do I install python?
